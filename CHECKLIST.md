1. OrderProcessor Class Implementation
   Ensure the following methods are implemented correctly in OrderProcessor:
   processTypeA(int $userId)

Description: Processes Type A orders and generates a CSV file with order details.

Checklist:

CSV filename is dynamically generated based on user ID and time.

Writes order details in CSV format.

If the order amount is greater than a threshold, a "High value order" note is added.

Sets the order status to EXPORTED or EXPORT_FAILED based on the success of file operations.

processTypeB(APIClient $apiClient)

Description: Processes Type B orders by calling an external API.

Checklist:

Calls the API using the APIClient.

Checks API response status and handles success or failure.

Sets the order status based on API response.

Catches APIException and sets status to API_FAILURE in case of an error.

handleSuccess(ApiResponse $apiResponse)

Description: Handles a successful API response for Type B orders.

Checklist:

Determines the correct order status based on the response amount and order flags.

Sets status to PROCESSED, PENDING, or ERROR based on conditions.

processTypeC()

Description: Processes Type C orders.

Checklist:

If the order has a flag, the status is set to COMPLETED.

Otherwise, sets the status to IN_PROGRESS.

2. OrderProcessingService Class Implementation
   Ensure the following methods are implemented correctly in OrderProcessingService:
   processOrder(Order $order, int $userId)

Description: Processes a single order based on its type (A, B, or C).

Checklist:

Calls the appropriate processType method in the OrderProcessor based on the order type.

Updates order priority based on the amount (HIGH for amounts above the threshold, otherwise LOW).

Calls updateOrderInDatabase to persist order status and priority.

updateOrderPriority(Order $order)

Description: Updates the priority of an order based on the amount.

Checklist:

Sets the priority to HIGH if the order amount exceeds a defined threshold.

Sets the priority to LOW otherwise.

updateOrderInDatabase(Order $order)

Description: Updates the status and priority of the order in the database.

Checklist:

Attempts to update the order in the database.

Catches any DatabaseException and sets the status to DB_ERROR if an error occurs.

3. Order Class Implementation
   Ensure the following attributes and methods are correctly implemented in Order:
   Attributes:

id, type, amount, flag, status, and priority.

status should default to NEW, and priority should default to LOW.

Methods:

getId(), getType(), getAmount(), getFlag(), getStatus(), setStatus(), getPriority(), setPriority().

Ensure proper accessors and mutators are present for each property.

4. FileWriter Class Implementation
   Ensure the following methods are correctly implemented in FileWriter:
   open(string $filename, string $mode)

Description: Opens a file in the specified mode and returns the file handle.

Checklist: Use fopen to open the file. Return a valid file handle or false on failure.

writeCsv($fileHandle, array $data)

Description: Writes a line of data to a CSV file.

Checklist: Use fputcsv to write the data to the file.

close($fileHandle)

Description: Closes the opened file.

Checklist: Use fclose to close the file handle.

5. DatabaseService Class Implementation
   Ensure that the DatabaseService class has a method for updating order status:
   updateOrderStatus(int $orderId, string $status, string $priority)

Checklist:

The method should update the status and priority of the order in the database.

Handle any potential DatabaseException that may occur during the update.

6. Unit Testing (for OrderProcessor and OrderProcessingService)
   OrderProcessor Test Cases:
   processTypeA:

Test for generating the CSV file and writing order details.

Ensure that the file is created, and data is written.

Test for "High value order" condition.

Ensure the order status is correctly set to EXPORTED or EXPORT_FAILED.

processTypeB:

Test for successful API response and setting the status to PROCESSED, PENDING, or ERROR based on the response.

Simulate API failure and ensure the status is set to API_FAILURE.

processTypeC:

Test for both COMPLETED and IN_PROGRESS statuses based on the order flag.

OrderProcessingService Test Cases:
processOrder:

Test for each order type (A, B, C) to ensure correct methods in OrderProcessor are called.

Test for updating the order priority and correctly persisting changes in the database.

7. APIClient Class and APIResponse Class
   Ensure that the APIClient class has the following:
   callAPI(int $orderId):

Simulates an API call and returns an APIResponse.

Ensure that the APIResponse class has the following:
status and data attributes.

status should be a string indicating the success/failure of the API call.

data should contain the response data, including the order details.

8. Exception Handling
   Ensure proper handling of exceptions in OrderProcessor and OrderProcessingService, such as:

DatabaseException in updateOrderInDatabase.

APIException in processTypeB.

9. Test Coverage
   Ensure that all the methods of the OrderProcessor and OrderProcessingService classes have sufficient test coverage.

Test edge cases like high-value orders, API failures, and database errors.

10. Code Style and Formatting
    Follow PSR-12 coding standards.

Ensure that all class and method names follow the proper naming conventions.

Properly format the code and add docblocks to all methods.
